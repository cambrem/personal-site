                    Secure Login system for Spring Boot applications, designed to be used with react. Initially, when a user attempts to log in, the browser sends the login informaton to the server. The server then encodes that data in a JSON Web Token and returns it to the client. The client then saves the JWT and uses it in the header for all future requests to the server, which then authenticates the JWT and returns a response to the client.
