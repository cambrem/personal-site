                <p>Born in England, I moved to New York when I was 6 years old. Growing up, I cultivated my creative spirit through crafts such as leatherwork and ceramics, as well as activites such as rock climbing, skateboarding, and surfing. I moved up to the Green Mountain state in 2018 to attend the University of Vermont, where I persued a degree in Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Design. I also continued to cultivate my interests in outdoor sports, frequently making trips to the rolling mountains of Vermont to climb, hike, and snowboard. Upon graduation, I launched my career as a software engineer while continuing to hone my eye for design in my spare time, learning as much creative tech as I could. I began working with 3D modeling software to render my design ideas into reality, all the while thinking about how I could apply my background to web design. The result of all my tinkering is that I've grown my ability to create elegent, creative, and informative websites that stay true to the artistic vision of a company.</p>
